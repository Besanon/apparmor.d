# Apparmor ships some unconfined profiles that allow everything and set the
# userns rules. This file keeps track of them and allow apparmor.d to replace
# them by our own.
# File format: one profile name by line.

# This is managed globally in this file and not in debian/apparmor.d.hide as
# it applies to all distributions using apparmor 4.0+. When needed, it is
# automatically enabled during prebuild.
